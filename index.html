    <h2>How-to:</h2>

    <ul>
    <li> double click an item to edit it
    <li> click the [] slack export checkbox to get it in a form to copy/paste into slack
    <li> if you haven't started working (bottom right), the unticked items will export as :black_square_button:
    <li> if you're working, the unticked items will export as ðŸ”²
    <li> if you're working and you add new items, they'll have an extra âž• (to show you didn't anticipate them) and be initially set to âž– (since you may have just started working on them anyway - click to change)
    <li> when you started working on an item, you can click on it and it will initially go to a âž– state, which shows that you did something. Click again to make it a âœ”
    <li> when you've finished working (bottom right), it will clear all the checked items and remove any âž– and âž• marks. i.e. you should export before you 'prepare for next' for daily-priorities, click 'prepare for next day', make the next/current day's list, then export again, then click 'start working' (edited) 
    </ul>
